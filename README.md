# Business Scenario

With the power of Oracle Integration Cloud process and workflow, we create Oracle Integration Cloud proccess application as backend engine. And for people already take adventages in Oracle APEX User Interface and oracle Database, you can easily build integrations with OIC and still use SSO as authorization scheme.

Here is a example of how to take advantage of this solution:

![Snipaste_2021-12-16_15-29-55](images/Snipaste_2021-12-16_15-29-55.png)

busniess workflow : 

APEX user submit form to active the proccess from APEX -> Sales Department first Comfirmation ->  Sales Department Second Approval  -> check for customer type if it is VIP customer -> Credit Department Third Comfirmation -> Credit Department Fourth Approval -> (Do anything you want) - > END proccess

Workflow is not fixed, your busniess changes and upgrade everyday. The old way people need change their program, doing development to fulfill the busniess need. Which will take days/months and the test and debug is nightmare. This solution avoid all of it. People can change existing workflow or link to new workflow as you need.  we can edit and manage workflow direcly in OIC application without change anything in APEX side.

And with this IDCS integration, inovate more. since OIC is integration cloud, your APEX now can easily connect to Saas applications,third-party SaaS and on-premises apps.
